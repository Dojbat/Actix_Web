This project is a Rust-based web service built with Actix Web, designed to manage tasks and interact with AWS services such as DynamoDB. The codebase is organized into modules for API endpoints, data models, and repository logic, providing a clean separation of concerns. It leverages Rustâ€™s performance and safety features to deliver a robust backend solution suitable for scalable task management applications, with AWS integration for cloud-based data storage and operations.
